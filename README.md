# yearly

> A React app used to display highlighted events from the scope of the entire year. At the time of creation (~ 10/2019), pages like Google Calendar can display highlighted events but only from the scope of a given month. This app will be able to project selected dates while you look at the entire year. Finally I will be able to keep track of everybody's birthdays.

## Tutorial

1. `mvn spring-boot:run`
